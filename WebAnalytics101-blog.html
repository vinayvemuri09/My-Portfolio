    <h1>Web Analytics 101 for Developers</h1>

    <h2>What is Web Analytics? </h2>

    <p>Web Analytics is a way of understanding how users interact with websites. We can get the idea of how impactful the
        website is and what all features and products on the website are performing well.</p>

    We can understand more with an example, If you have an eCommerce website where you sell “Plants”. Now with web
    analytics, we can understand which country and city users are buying more, which Plant is selling more, how many
    users clicked on a particular product, what did they search on the website, how many people left the site after
    checkout steps, etc, You can literally understand users intent and also understand website features performance to
    make it better.

    Web Analytics makes understanding data simple. We can implement Web analytics on any blogs to understand readers,
    eCommerce websites, or any website which is public to use.

    <h2>Why is it necessary for any Web apps?</h2>
    Today’s world revolves around Data, Today with many things going around digital it is necessary to understand data.
    The better we understand the better we can develop our product around user needs. Web Analytics is a must for all
    websites to understand users interests and website growth analysis.


    <h2>Free tool for Web Analytics, Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>We have multiple Web Analytics tools in the market which specialize for different use cases. Most of the tools are
    paid but Google Analytics is a tool which is completely free and can be used for most of the use cases ( There is a
    paid Google Analytics version too but can be useful only for very very large traffic websites).</p> 

    <p>Google Analytics has now two versions Universal Google Analytics and Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</p> 
    
    <p>For simplification, GA4 is the next version of Universal Google Analytics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Universal Google Analytics can help to track website data</li>
        <li>Google Analytics 4 (GA4) can help to track website and App data.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    

    We will consider Universal Google Analytics for now, which is enough to track and understand websites. I will write
    another blog about Google Analytics 4 (GA4) more indepthly.

    <h2> How to implement Google Analytics on a website?</h2>
    <p>When we create an account in Google Analytics, we get tracking code. Now we need to paste this code in all the pages
        in the website. Once tracking code is present in all the pages, data will start getting tracked in Google Analytics.
        To track more customized events we can use Google Tag Manager which can help in implementing customized events by
        setting triggers and tags.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    

    <p> Google Analytics is a free tool to track web analytics on the website. We can understand user behaviour of the user and make changes accordingly to increase the traction.</p>
